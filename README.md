# Linux From Scratch (LFS) for Raspberry Pi 
This repo aims to provide a step-by-step guide in order to build your own custom linux system on Raspberry Pi, completely from scratch. 
#### Why LFS ? 
  1.  Learn how a Linux System works internally
  2.  Building very compact Linux Systems. There are LFS enthusiasts out there who were able to install a system that was just enough to run the Apache web server, total disk space usage was approximately 8 MB. With further stripping, that can be brought down to 5 MB or less. Try that with a regular distribution ðŸ‘€.
  3.  LFS is extremely flexible. You can literally skip so many plug-ins which you really do not need but they come with regular distribution by default. 
## Prerequisites
In order to build LFS, following are the prerequisites you need:
  1.  Desktop Linux machine (Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS in my case)
  2.  Micro SD Card and Card Reader (I'm currently using 32 GB SD card)
  3.  Raspberry Pi 4 (This tutorial will guide you to build a 64-bit Debian dist on RPI 4 but the same applies for RPI 3B)
  Rest of the stuff is required after we prepare our SD card
  4.  LAN cable
  5.  USB-to-C/USB-to-B cable for RPI 4/RPI 3B respectively
  6.  Micro HDMI-to-HDMI/HDMI-to-HDMI cable for RPI 4/RPI 3B respectively
  7.  Monitor with HDMI support and Keyboard 
## Installing VMware and Ubuntu Desktop
Virtual Machines are better than dual boot system when you have to switch between windows and linux machines
  1.  Most updated VMware setup is available [here](https://www.vmware.com/latam/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html) and Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS can be downloaded from [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
  2.  Installing VMware is pretty straight forward, just make sure to select 'non-commercial use only' when prompted.
  3.  Once installed, create new vitual machine and browse Installer Disc Image (the one you just downloaded). 
  4.  Personalize your linux, set disk size, 50-70 GB is required but 100.0 GB is recommended and make sure to select "Store virtual Disk as single file" as it improves some performance. 
  5.  In hardware customization, set RAM and CPU cores half of your system's RAM and CPU cores respectively and finish installation.
